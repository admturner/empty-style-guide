# Styles
#
# Define all of your styles here. Notice these are separated by UI and Pattern
# Library styles. The UI styles are for the style guide site itself, and the
# Pattern Library styles are for the site you are documenting. The UI style(s)
# are called by `_includes/head.html`.
#
# The Pattern Library styles are called by `_includes/pattern-styles.html` and
# printed with the `_layouts/pattern.html` layout. Note that the pattern styles
# are further subdivided by "development" and "production" to allow for pointing
# to separate stylesheets.
