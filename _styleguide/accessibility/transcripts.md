Audio and video are frequently used to deliver content on websites. To ensure web accessibility and to allow all users access, website audio content (like podcasts, spoken feedback, etc.) requires a transcript, and website videos require synchronized closed captioning.

## Captions

Captions are a text display of all speech and other sound effects occurring in a video. Anything said in the video must be included in the closed captioning, and anything in the closed captioning must be said in the video.

Captions must be provided in the same language as the spoken language in a video, can be turned on and off (closed) or can only be on (open), and can be added to recorded or live video.

## Transcripts

Transcripts provide a textual version of the content that can be accessed by anyone. They also allow the content of your multimedia to be searchable, both by computers (such as search engines) and by site visitors. Users may also prefer the transcript over listening to the audio of the web multimedia.

Transcripts do not have to be verbatim accounts of the spoken word in a video. They should provide additional descriptions, explanations, and comments to convey the full meaning of the multimedia content, such as indications of laughter or tone.

For most web video, both captions and a text transcript should be provided. For audio-only content, a transcript will usually be enough.

## Audio Descriptions

Audio descriptions are intended for users with visual disabilities. They provide additional information about what is visible on the screen. Audio descriptions are helpful on the web if visual content in web video provides important content not available through the audio alone.

If web video is produced with accessibility in mind, then audio descriptions are often unnecessary. For example, as long as visual elements within the video are described in the audio there is no need for separate audio descriptions.
