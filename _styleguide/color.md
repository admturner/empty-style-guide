### Color Contrast

People have varying visual abilities (e.g. color blindness, low vision, age-related visual issues, etc.) and use a range of technologies (computers, phone, tablet, monitors with varying color display, etc.) to access websites. All of these can affect how they perceive the color used on a website. When color is an essential part of conveying information on a website, people who cannot see or distinguish certain colors may encounter difficulties and may not access the website content.

<!-- example -->

Donâ€™t use color alone to convey important information, to alert a user, or to show emphasis on a website. Uses who cannot see that color may very likely miss that information. When using color to convey meaning, alert a user, or show emphasis needs always pair it with another visual cue so users can identify the importance without having to depend on color alone.
