Headings are the titles and subtitles used within text content. They help draw attention to content sections within a web page and organize content into related groups.

Using a clear heading structure helps improve the user experience by:

* Providing a consistent look for a site.
* Offering a hierarchical structure for web page content.
* Providing guidance for users to easily navigate and quickly scan (either visually or with a screen reader) for the information they seek.

## Headings and Screen Readers

Screen readers and speech software, like <abbr title="NonVisual Desktop Access">NVDA</abbr>, <abbr title="Job Access with Speech">JAWS</abbr>, Orca, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, allow people who are blind or visually impaired to read text on a website. They are also useful for users who choose to listen to speech output of a page rather than view it. Users of these tools often start by scanning for headings to help them quickly learn what content is on a web page. For people who use screen readers, clear heading hierarchies are critical for navigating and scanning a page.

## Common Usability Errors

* Bold text and/or larger text size is used to represent a heading instead of using the heading tags
* Heading levels are skipped
* Heading levels are out of order
* There are multiple Heading 1 <h1> headings
* A Heading 1 (Page title) is not used
* Heading tags are used, but there is no content between the tags to identify the heading content (e.g. `<h2> </h2>`)
