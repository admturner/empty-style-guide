What is "Alt Text"? Alternative (Alt) text is an informative description of images, graphs, and diagrams as they relate to content on a web page. Alt text also provides an alternative method for users to access the meaning conveyed by images and graphics. This is especially important to those who depend on assistive technology (e.g. screen reader) to help them interact with websites.

When alt text is added to images and graphics, it provides descriptive information about an image when it is not available to the user. An image’s alt text is not typically visible on a web page, but alt text will replace images when images are turned off on websites, when images do not load, and when a screen reader is used to read out website content.

Alt text also has a positive impact on search engine ranking. Adding clear alt text descriptions to images allows search engine crawlers to more appropriately index images. Google and Bing count alt text as part of the on-page text because it is exactly that for visually impaired users. Therefore, setting good alt text on images also benefits a user’s experience because it can make web page content more discoverable.

To ensure website accessibility, all images, graphs, or diagrams must have alt text. However, include an empty alt text attribute for images and graphics that are purely decorative. Review this video to learn more about alt text and how a screen reader interacts with images on the web:

How to Write Effective Alt Text
Writing alt text can be a challenge, but following these best practices will help you create appropriate alt text. When developing a text alternative, think about the role that the image plays on the page. It should sufficiently describe what is being presented.

It needs to convey the same information as the image in the given context.
Write a clear, succinct description of the image, and keep the explanation brief.
Description should not exceed a short sentence or two. Ideally, the description should be less than 100 characters because some screen readers will not read after 125 characters.
No need to provide every tiny detail in the image – In most cases this is not necessary, and can become verbose.
Screen readers will identify images by default, so don’t start alt text with “Image of,” “Photo of,” or something similar.
Include a period at the end of the alt text.
The period allows the screen reader to pause after the last word in the alt text.

Decorative images: Include an empty alt attribute (alt="") when the only purpose of an image is to add visual decoration to a web page.
This will help screen readers skip the image.
This needs to be completed to avoid a web accessibility error.

Complex images: These include graphs, charts, diagrams, maps, and illustrations, which frequently require longer descriptions. Below are some ways to add a longer text description for complex images:
Add description as a caption for the image.
In addition to the brief alt text description, add the detailed description in the surrounding web page text.
Link out to a separate web page to provide the longer description.
Common Alt text Errors
The file name (e.i. "12345_img12.jpg”) of the image is used for the alt text.
“Image of” or “Photo of”, etc. is used as part of the image description.
“Photo” is the only alt text used to describe an image; alt text is not descriptive.
The image caption and the image alt text are the same.
The image photographer or copyright information is the description for the alt text instead of the caption.
