<h2>Quick-Guide</h2>

<p>Avoid manually adjusting colors at the content level. Most of the time colors will be set at the theme level in order to ensure a unified look and experience.</p>
<p>If you need to use different colors &ndash; or would like a custom design &ndash; please contact the site administrators and they&rsquo;ll be happy to work with you to develop a solution.</p>

## To Restore Default Text Color

In most situations you should rely on the default text color for any given element. Follow these instructions to reset text to its default color:

* On the Add/Edit Post screen, select the "Toggle Toolbar" button in the text editor menu to show the additional text options.

* Highlight the text you want to reset, then select the "Text color" dropdown menu in the additional text options toolbar and choose "No color" (towards the lower right of the menu, indicated by an "X").

## Things to Correct If You See Them

* Non-link text is colored to resemble link text (in the case of HRS, this means underlined text and red colored text.) Correct this by restoring the default text color.

* Text appears in a color other than the site default (black). Correct this by restoring the default text color.

* Text or other content lacks sufficient contrast with its background. Contact site administrators.

* Color alone is used to convey important information, to alert a user, or to show emphasis. Contact site administrators.
