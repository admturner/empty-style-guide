title: Cards

Cards may contain an image, text, and a link about a single subject. They may vary in the amount of content they present, but should not provide too much detail. They have a constrained width, but their height can vary.

Intended as an entry point to more complex or detailed information and content, such as a post in a list of posts. Use when you have a list of varied content (such as a series of posts, or a collection of items with different data types) that requires more than a few lines.

### Use Instead

[Data Tables](/patterns/components/data-tables/) If your content is made up of raw tabular data, usually including a header row and three or more columns.

[Grid Lists](/patterns/components/grid-lists/) If your content is of an identical or very similar type (such as a collection of images or magazine covers and titles).

[Row Lists](/patterns/components/row-lists/) If your collection is of similar content and only one or two lines, such as a list of titles with very small thumbnail images or a directory of pages.
