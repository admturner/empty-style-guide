title: "Data Tables"

TODO: Needs a style update to align with TablePress styles:

* Target `<thead>` to style the header row, not `:first-child`.
* Provide more spacing around items.
* Don't style them with ID, use class instead.

A data table should include a header row that lists column names, followed by rows of data.

Use if your content is made up of raw tabular data, usually including a header row and three or more columns.

Can be embedded in cards.

### Use Instead

[Cards](/patterns/components/cards/) If you have a collection of varied content or content with inconsistent formatting, or if you need to convey more detailed information.

[Grid Lists](/patterns/components/grid-lists/) If your content is of an identical or very similar type (such as a collection of images or magazine covers and titles).

[Row Lists](/patterns/components/row-lists/) If your collection is of similar content and only one or two lines, such as a list of titles with very small thumbnail images or a directory of pages.
