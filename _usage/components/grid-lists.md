title: "Grid Lists"
---

TODO: Check to make sure these class and style definitions are generic enough to apply to any content collection (something like: `.gallery, .grid-list`); or create a `grid-list` mixin.

A repeated set of tiles arrayed in a grid of cells with one or more columns.

Use to display identical or very similar content types (such as a collection of images or magazine covers and titles).

### Use Instead

[Cards](/patterns/components/cards/) If you have a collection of varied content or content with inconsistent formatting, or if you need to convey more detailed information.

[Data Tables](/patterns/components/data-tables/) If your content is made up of raw tabular data, usually including a header row and three or more columns.

[Row Lists](/patterns/components/row-lists/) If your collection is of similar content and only one or two lines, such as a list of titles with very small thumbnail images or a directory of pages.
