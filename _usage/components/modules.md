TODO:

* Work on these styles.
* Update the stylesheets with the correct class names (and move old class names to Deprecated section).
* Get this working with Gutenberg modules.

Modules compartmentalize content to highlight it or distinguish it from surrounding content. They should be used judiciously, but can be useful for drawing attention.

Modules come in three types:

* Regular
* Call to action
* Alert
