title: Buttons

TODO: There are currently too many button styles. Reduce these to one primary style with two general variants:

* Action button & navigation button: for buttons that move between areas on the site, for these use `button` and `<a class="button"></a>` elements)
	- "Raised" and prominent
	- Versions for positive (white text on @crimson background) and neutral (@crimson text on white background, with @crimson border -- the hover state of the positive version)
* Flat button: for highlighted links that aren't as high priority, for these always use `<a class="button-flat"><a>` elements).
	- No background when at rest, with a background on focus and activate
	- Always @crimson text
