TODO:

* We should make the medium image size larger.

To add an image to a WordPress Page or Post, use the `Add Media` button in the editor.

* **Make sure to include alternate text for all images describing the content of the image.**
* Captions are optional.
* Select the appropriate size for the context of your image (don't use sizes larger than you need, and generally never select the full size).
